## Getting a Dog



I think whether you are a dog or cat person is strongly influenced by if you had a good dog or cat as a child. My partner Ashley grew up with a Shih Tzu and wanted a dog. I said if we got a dog, I wanted a big, fluffy dog, We ended up putting our name down for the San Francisco Samoyed Rescue (SFSR).

One Friday, they called us to see if we could foster a dog the next day. The urgency was because a shelter in Modesto had an outbreak of Parvo (roughly a contagious dog dysentery). They needed to place all the dogs into homes for a bit while they disenfected the shelter. This dog, Cloud, had separation anxiety and could only be placed somewhere where the owner worked from home.

Cloud didn't have a lot of history with him. A week before, his previous owners had taken him for 2 days and than returned him. They didn't work from home and during the day he was digging up their yard to escape and look for them. We figured that he didn't like being left home alone, so we stayed around him the first couple weeks until he settled in.


The first time we left him home was for a couple hours to do some shopping at Target. We put him in his crate, which he slept in at night, because we weren't sure if he had any descrutive tendancies. When we got back home, he had escaped from the crate and taken a bit out of a window slat from every window blind. His water bowl was knocked over in the kitchen, and he had managed to rip out a garage door trip sensor.

This separation anxiety was much more serious than just being sad. We knew if we kept him this would take a serious commitment in terms of time, energy and money.


Cloud never really responded to his name. We went down a list of potential dog names and yelled them at Cloud untill he responded to us. Thats how Cloud got his new name: Echo. We reached out to SFSR to see if they could recommend a trainer, and eventually ended up working with Shoshi Parks.


## Shoshi Parks

Shoshi is a positive reinforcement dog trainer. She lives in San Francisco, but out engament with her was over Video Conference calls. Her basic theory of training is a form of progressive desensitization, but in a manner such that the dog is not "panicking". When a dog is panicking or above some theoretical level of stress they are no longer learning. Too much stress can also cause a "regression" in behavior where a dog would be uncomfortable being left home alone for periods of time they were previously comfortable with.


Working with a trainer is not cheap. What are the benefits of a trainer versus doing it yourself?

We worked with Shoshi for 2 weeks before she recommended our vet get Echo a prescription for Prozac. His training before, according to her experience indicated that it would be hard to make progress without it. After putting Echo on it we waited 6 weeks before re-engaging with Shoshi.

If you have a dog with a light case of separation anxiety, it may make sense to try to train yourself. Start with 0 minutes out of the house. Do all your pre-leaving rituals like grabing phone, wallet, keys, putting on shoes, and slowly work your way up from 10 seconds to an hour at 10% increments.

- Stress management. This includes being able to correctly identify cues of stress and panic, to trying to model day-to-day dog cortisol levels. Ashley and I were pretty "Type A" personality with the training. Shoshi helped balance things on the other end by limiting training sessions to a particular time frame per day, a certain number of days per week and also calling out additional break days when he was not performing well.

## Balanced Training

Positive Reinforcement (R+) Adds something to increase the frequency of a behavior. Example: You reward your dog with a treat when they sit.

Negative Reinforcement (R-) Removes something to increase the frequency of a behavior. Example: The handler asks a dog to sit while applying upward pressure on a prong collar. Once the dog sits, the pressure is removed.

Positive Punishment (P+) â€“ Adds something to decrease the frequency of a behavior. Example:  Handler administers an e-collar stimulation when the dog goes after a squirrel on the trail in order to call them off the squirrel.

Negative Punishment (R-) Removing something to decrease the frequency of a behavior. Example: If your dog jumps on you, then you remove your attention from them until they stop jumping.

Balanced Training is controversial. The data out there suggests postive reinforcement gives better results than using any form of Punishment. If you care about results (or ethical treatment of dogs) it makes sense to skew towards Positive Reinforcement.
However, long after Echo was comfortable being left home alone


- Cost. itis not cheap
- An experienced trainer had better ideas on which cues indicate a dog is panicking.

- Tie breaker when parents disagree
